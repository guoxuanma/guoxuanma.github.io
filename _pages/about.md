I am an assistant professor in the Research Institute for Global Value Chains (RIGVC) at University of International Business and Economics (UIBE). I graduated from the Department of Economics at The Pennsylvania State University in 2022. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of Industrial Organization and Applied Macroeconomics which focuses on the influence of information asymmetry problem.  I am also interested in information asymmetry oriented empirical research in Auction and Social Insurance.
