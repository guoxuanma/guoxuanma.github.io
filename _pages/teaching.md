### Math Camp 2022, UIBE 

The purpose of this course is to equip you all with basic mathematical tools you will need to tackle
fundamental problems in micro, macro and econometrics. We will go through several economic
examples along the way to familiarize ourselves with each concept. At the end of this course you
should be comfortable with solving systems of equations, unconstrained and constrained optimization
in multiple variables, the envelope theorem, necessary and sufficient conditions for optimization
and the meaning of the Lagrange multiplier.
