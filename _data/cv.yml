      year: 2022
      description: 
      Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of access to different financing choices on young firms'
                  future growth paths. According to the Kauffman Firm Survey data, over 2/3 of debt firms rely on credit
                  card borrowing in the first five years of development. I construct a firm life-cycle model with financing
                  constraints to address selection issues involved in the endogenous financing decisions. In this model,
                  firms can simultaneously choose up to three debt financing sources--business bank loans, personal bank
                  loans, and credit card borrowing. I find many firms increase their debt leverage, particularly through
                  credit card borrowing, to avoid shrinking their businesses in bad times. Also, without credit card borrowing,
                  debt firms quickly clear their debt within 4 years of development and assets accumulation level
                  can drop by 11%. In the counterfactual analysis, I estimate how young firms react to the increasing
                  financing cost caused by the local bank industry concentration. The increasing financing cost can lead
                  to a rise in the ratio of debt firms with business bank loans by forcing firms that rely on credit card
                  borrowing to clear their outstanding debt. When the financing cost is not too high for business loan
                  borrowers, this selection mechanism can shift the firm size distribution to the right.

      year: 2022
      description:     
      Abstract: In the canonical common value English auction with asymmetric information, the identity of the
                insider is assumed to be mandatory known by the public and thus her existence often induces
                more aggressive competition. However, when the identity revelation is not enforceable, the
                insider can choose whether to reveal or not based on strategic interactions with her rivals. This
                could have no trivial impact on bidding outcomes. empirical evidence from Chinese Judicial
                Auction for real estate shows that the winning price declines when the insider voluntarily reveal
                her identity. To reconcile the conflicts between the data and theory, we introduce the information
                revelation decision process into the standard theoretical framework. Our model shows that
                the insider may reveal her identity when she receives a bad or very good signal. Also, the
                impact from the informed bidder decreases as the number of participants increases and the
                effect depends on the level of information frictions. Based on the theoretical framework, we
                overcome the identification challenge and construct parametric structure estimation algorithm
                to recover the value function distribution. Our estimation results find that first, common value
                part dominates the bidder's private value part of the selling house. Second, the noisy component
                is nontrivial. These two features give the informed bidder's opportunity to take advantage of
                strategic bidding. Informed bidder can leverage her information advantage to influence the
                bidding activities. For example, adopting both active and inactive bidding strategies, the insider
                can shift the winning price distribution leftward by dampening the bidding competition.

#       year: 2022
#       description: 
#       Appendix: <a href="/assets/pdf/Online_Appendix_Final_Version.pdf">Online Appendix</a>
#       Abstract: 'Conventional' monetary policy involves actions by the monetary and fiscal authorities -- the
#                 former sets a nominal interest rate and the latter sets lump-sum taxes to finance the implied flow of
#                 interest payments on government debt. We model such policy within an overlapping generations framework
#                 and show that absent any other frictions the magnitude of the nominal interest rate gives rise
#                 to asset substitution between government debt and either private debt or capital substitution which has
#                 both real and nominal effects. Such substitution is not in standard New Keynesian models because those
#                 models use a dynastic specification in which government debt is not net wealth.
